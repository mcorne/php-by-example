Coding standards
================

Note that this document is a rough draft and incomplete.

- self explanatory class, method and var names, underscore separated name compounds
- never return an expression but a variable
- all functions are public, public is always omitted
- most properties are created on the fly, possibly with a getter
- methods must be short, fit for unit testing
- class name and file name must match so the object can be created on the fly
- alpha order except __construct, __destruct at the beginning, followed by magic methods, getters _get_* etc.
