PHP Manuals update process
==========================

Note that the process must take place in the development environment.


1. Download the manuals
-----------------------

- backup the "public/manual" directory outside of the project directory
- go to "scripts"
- run "download_manuals *"


2. Update the PHP Manual in English
-----------------------------------

- go to "scripts"
- run "update_manuals en"

- go to "http://localhost/php-by-example/en"
- verify for a few functions that the PHP manual is displayed correctly, including "see also" functions
- click on "PHP Manual" within the manual to check the date is correct

Note that obsolete files are not removed.


3. Update the PHP Manual in other languages
-------------------------------------------

- go to "scripts"
- run "update_manuals *"

For each language, for example "fr":
- go to "http://localhost/php-by-example/fr"
- verify for a few functions that the PHP manual is displayed correctly, for example "array_diff"
- click on "PHP Manual" within the manual to check the date is correct

- copy the content of "public/manual" from the development machine to the production machine

Note that obsolete files are not removed.
