Coding standards
----------------

self explanatory class, method and var names, underscore separated name compounds
never return an expression but a variable
all functions are public, public is always omitted
most properties are created on the fly, possibly with a getter
methods must be short, fit for unit testing
class name and file name must match so the object can be created on the fly
alpha order except __construct, __destruct at the beginning, followed by magic methods, getters _get_* etc.
