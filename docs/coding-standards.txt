Coding standards
----------------

self explanatory class, method and var names, underscore separated name compounds
never return an expression but a variable
all functions are public, public is always omitted
properties are fixed or dynamic:
* fixed properties must be explicitly defined in the class
* dynamic properties are created on the fly, possibly with a getter, they may be reset with object::reset_dynamic_properties()
methods must be short, fit for unit testing
class name and file name must match so the object can be created on the fly
alpha order except __construct, __destruct at the beginning, followed by magic methods, getters _get_* etc.
