coding standards
----------------

no camel case, name self explanatory
never return an expression but a variable
all functions are public, public is always omitted
properties are not defined as they are created on the fly
methods must be short, ready for unit testing
class name, file name and property name of object must match so they can be created on the fly
alpha order except __construct, __destruct first, followed by magic methods, getters _get_* etc.
