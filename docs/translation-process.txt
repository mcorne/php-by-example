Translation process
-------------------

Note that most of the process must take place in the development environment.
This ensures that message translations and translators access rights are stored in the version control repository.
The only part of the process done in the production environment is the message validation or changes by the translators.


1. Check messages to translate
------------------------------

- go to "scripts"
- run "check_translations"

- if "obsolete english message ids" are reported:
* commment these messages in "data/translations/en.php"
* note that message ids must not be reused

- if "missing english messages" are reported:
* add each message in the corresponding section of "data/translations/en.php"
* add a new section at the end if the message does not fit in an existing section (see the note on sections)
* use the next available message id

Note that "missing translated message ids" and "obsolete translated message ids" are just reported for information purposes.

Note on sections:
- a section corresponds to a logical unit of the interface, eg the top bar messages, the home page messages etc.
- a section begins with a message id that is a multiple of 100, and the section title, eg "Top bar", "Home page" etc.
- if you need to add a new section


2. Machine translate new messages
---------------------------------

For each new message:
- machine translate the message in each language with google or bing etc.
- add the translation in each language in the corresponding translation file, eg "data/translations/fr.php" for French
  use the same message id as the original message in English in "data/translations/en.php"


3. Updade the translations in action
------------------------------------

- if "obsolete english message ids" are reported, remove the corresponding entries in "data/translations_in_action.php"

For each "missing english messages" reported:
- add an entry in "data/translations_in_action.php"
* go to eg "http://php-by-example.local/fr/translation"
* select one language
* enter the admin credentials
* select the message
* click on "See the curent translation in action" to verify the translation is properly highlighted
  

4. Double-check messages to translate
-------------------------------------

- run "check_translations" (again)
- verify that no message is reported obsolete or missing


5. Validate translations
------------------------

- copy "data/translations" to production

For each translator in a each language:
- obfuscate the translator email, eg in "scripts" run "obfuscate_email jsmith@mail.com"
- add/check the entry for this translator in "data/translators.php", eg "naAgnKEbDT1unJjhL29g" => [fr]
- hash the translation key of the translator, eg in "scripts" run "hash_translation_key jsmith@mail.com"
- make the link to the translation page, eg "http://micmap.org/php-by-example/fr/translation?email=jsmith@mail.com&translation_key=6445521bed130aed928ec9eda4b67ee8"
- verify the link works
- email the request for translation and the link to the translator

Note that the obfuscation of emails is not a security feature, it only prevents storing emails in the clear in the version control repository.


6. Update translations
