Function configuration
----------------------


Example values
--------------

- scalars and arrays are allowed, eg 123 , 'abc' , "def\nghi" , [123, 'a' => ['xyz']]
- expressions and operators are not allowed, excepted for constants

- escaped characters in a string enclosed in double quotes are interpreted, eg "abc\ndef", see parser::parse_string()
- variables within a string are not allowed

- a variable must be enclosed with single quotes, eg '$var'
- a constant must be enclosed with quotes, eg 'E_ERROR', it will converted to its value automatically
- a list of constants must be enclosed with quotes and separated with "|", eg 'ENT_QUOTES | ENT_IGNORE'
- false, true, null must not be enclosed with quotes, otherwise there are considered as string
 
- a regex pattern should ideally be enclosed between single quotes, eg '|<[^>]+>(.*)</[^>]+>|U'
- a regex pattern entered between double quotes may produce unexpected behaviour for parsing reasons, see parser::parse_string()
- a regex pattern will always be displayed between single quotes, see converter::convert_string_to_text()
