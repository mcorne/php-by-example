- scalars and arrays are allowed, eg 123 , 'abc' , "def\nghi" , [123, 'a' => ['xyz']]

- escaped characters in a string enclosed in double quotes are interpreted, see parser::parse_string()
- variables within a string are not allowed

- a variable must be enclosed with single quotes, eg '$var'
- a constant must be enclosed with single quotes, eg 'E_ERROR', it will converted to its value
- a list of constants must be enclosed with single quotes and separated with "|", eg 'ENT_QUOTES | ENT_IGNORE'
 
- a regex pattern should ideally be enclosed between single quotes, eg '|<[^>]+>(.*)</[^>]+>|U'
